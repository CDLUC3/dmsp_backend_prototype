## ACCOUNT CREATION workflow

1. Enter email address and click continue.
    a. If email is already used then display message that it is registered already and stop
2. If the email domain matches one that is present in the affiliations table and SSO is enabled then show the "Login method" screen which gives a choice to log in by SSO or with a local account.
3. If SSO is chosen then continue with SSO workflow, otherwise continue with the next step.
4. Go to the "Create a DMP account" form with First and Last name, institution autocomplete, email and password and confirm password, accept terms form elements that must be filled correctly.
    a. If there are problems with missing information or unmatched passwords then display message and require them to fill
5. On success, create their account with the information entered and send the user an email asking them to confirm their email.
6. Redirect to user dashboard as logged in user.

## SSO Signup Workflow
1. Affiliation detected from matching domain name of email and sent to shibboleth using the entityID associated with the affiliation along with a callback URL to go to after successful login. The affiliation ID is also passed through the shibboleth workflow.
2. Shibboleth redirects to the correct URL for login from their individual SSO.
3. After successful login, SSO returns some metadata about the user to the callback URL (metadata completeness may vary by institution).
4. Callback endpoint maps whatever metadata has been made available into the fields matching our sign up form.  The ID (email) from shibboleth they used for sign-in is put into the field ssoid. They are redirected to a "complete sign up" form with the data.
5. A "complete sign up" form is displayed which includes First/last name, institution pre-filled and read-only (based on the affiliation they used to log in), email pre-filled and read-only, and "accept terms." The ssoid is a hidden field and will be submitted as part of this form (it cannot be changed).
6. On submit with correct information, the user account is created already marked as verified since they validated their email by logging in by SSO. They are redirected to the user dashboard as a logged in user.

## Diagram for Login (both SSO and non-SSO)

## Login Workflow
1. The user is presented with a form that only asks for their email address and they click submit.
2. If the user isn't found or the user doesn't have an ssoid in their record then they're presented with a password field in the form.  Otherwise go to the SSO Login workflow
3. User enters their password and clicks login.
4. If the login is successful then they're redirected to the user dashboard as a logged in user, otherwise they see messages about login failure and are allowed to retry.

## Login SSO Workflow
1. The user's ssoid is used to match an affiliation based on the ssoid domain and the affiliation domain.  They are redirected using the shibboleth entityID for the affiliation and with a callback URL.
2. The user enters login credentials at their external SSO site.  Upon success they are redirected back to the callback URL.
3. At the callback URL for successful login, the ssoid is used to match to the user record.  If the user required fields are complete they have sign-in timestamps updated and they are then redirected to the user dashboard page.
4. If the user record does not contain all the required fields, they are presented with a form like the sign-up workflow with existing values pre-filled and must update it.
5. They are redirected to the dashboard page as a logged in user.

## Email Verification Diagram

Email verification may be triggered by signing up for a non-SSO account or by creating a new email alias for an existing account (from user profile area)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Start: User receives verification email] --> B[User clicks verification link]

  B --> C{Is token still valid?}

  C -- Yes --> D[Set email as verified in user record]
  D --> E[Delete token from database]
  E --> F[Show success message: Email verified]

  C -- No --> G[Show error message: Link invalid or expired]
  G --> H[Suggest resending verification link from user dashboard with link]

  F --> I[End]
  H --> I
```

## Email verification workflow
1. The user receives an email with a verification link that is sent from signing up or creating a new email alias.
2. User clicks the verification link in the email
3. If the link contains a valid token, then they receive a message that their email is verified, the verified flag is set to true in the user record, and the token is removed from the database.
4. If no valid token is found, then they receive a message that the verification link is invalid or expired with the message that they may resend another verification link from their user dashboard page (with link to it).
