# DMP Tool Apollo Server Change Log

### Added
- Added local data migrations to set default member role and set the createdById for seed users 
- Added a `allProjects` resolver to return all projects relevant to the Admin
- Added a new `test-no-db` script to `package.json` to run all tests but the ones that need a running docker env
- Added a data migration SQL file to drop all existing tables and recreate with `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` collation and use of `INT UNSIGNED` for ids
- Added a data migration SQL file to create the stored procedures needed by the related works matching process
- Added seed SQL files for use in local dev environments
- Added models, resolvers, mutators for Guidance, GuidanceGroup, VersionedGuidance and versionedGuidanceGroup [#12]
- Added `AffiliationDepartments` model
- Added `TemplateLinks` and `VersionedTemplateLinks` models
- Added `slug` to the `Tag` schema

### Updated
- Fixed an issue with the the `addProject` resolver not returning errors

- Updated dependencies: `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb`, `@graphql-tools/merge`, `ts-jest` and `@eslint/js`
- Updated the `myProjects` resolver to only return the projects the user owns or collaborates on
- Updated husky precommit hook to run `npm run test-no-db`

### Fixed
- Fixed migration error for versionedGuidance where can't be too strict since NULLs set for deleted parent Guidance. Related to [#12]

- Updated the `project` resolver and schema so that `searchExternalProjects` has its own `input` type definition
- Exposed the DynamoDB port in the local `docker-compose.yaml` so that AWS CLI commands can be run against it
- Discovered some intermittent issues with the new MySQL connection pool. Changed `keepAliveInitialDelay` to zero and also added an `initPromise` to the class so that we can effectively wait for the connection pool to finish initializing before attaching it to the Apollo server context
- Updated the `index.ts` to use the new `initPromise` and also added some missing `process.exit` statements
- Found that `Collaborator` classes were not awaiting the call to `super` in their `isValid` functions

- Updated most tests since they mostly require tokens which require email which is now async because it comes from the UserEmail model.
- Updated resolvers, models and controllers to use correct methods for using email from the UserEmail model (or use convenience method `getEmail` on the User model).
- Updated table `user.failed_sign_in_attemps` to be spelled correctly as `failed_sign_in_attempts`
- Updated `sections` and `questions` queries to order by `displayOrder` [#324]

- Replaced all instances of `TemplateVisibility.PRIVATE` with `TemplateVisibility.ORGANIZATION` [#159]
- Renamed the `outputTypes` table to `projectOutputTypes`
- Updated `buildspec` to allow for a "MODE" env variable to be set so that we can run migrations, tests and the build separately

- Moved config for `MysSQLDataSource` from the datasource into its config file
- Moved `SigTerm` handler tests for `mysql` into a separate test file. They were failing for some reason when run together

### Removed
- Removed self referential foreign key constraints from the `users` table (makes it impossible to delete user records)
- Removed `NOT NULL` constraint from the `users.affiliationId` field (makes it hard to create an initial user record)
- Dropped the `versionedQuestions.questionTypeId` field and foreign key constraints (missed this one when those changes were made)
- Removed test MySQL from the docker-compose.yaml
- Removed test DB values from `.env.example`
- Removed logic that used the test MySQL DB in the `data-migrations/nuke-db.sh` and `data-migrations/process.sh` scripts
- Dropped the `email` from the `users` table
- Dropped FKeys on `users` and `affiliations`
- Dropped `questionTypes` and `questionOptions` tables
- Dropped the `questionTypeId` field from the `questions` and `versionedQuestions` tables
- Dropped the `answerText` field from `answers`
- Removed the old `QuestionType` and `QuestionOptions` schema and resolvers
- Removed the `getQuestionOptionsToRemove` from `questionService`.
- Dropped all previous `data-migration` files in favor of the new `init-tables` and `init-seed` files
- Removed duplicate section check from `Section.create` that was just going off of the "name"
- Dropped the `PlanVersion` table
- Removed `prepareAPITarget` function.
- Removed `id` from `Project` model's constructor (already handled in base `MySQLModel`)
- Removed old `dmphubAPI` datasource and renamed `dmptoolAPI` to `dmpHubAPI`
- Old DMPHubAPI datasource and renamed DMPToolAPI to DMPHubAPI since that one had all of the new auth logic

### Fixed
- Added `publishedQuestions` to the `versionedQuestion` resolver to return all published questions with boolean for answered or not.
- Fixed a bug where clients calling `createTemplateVersion` in the `template` resolver would get an error when trying to publish because adding data to `versionedQuestions` required that `questionTypeId` not be null. I added a data-migration script to allow null because I believe we store the question type in the `json` field now and do not require `questionTypeId` [#328]
- Update profile was not working due to missing `createdById` and `modifiedById` values in db. Added data migration script to populate those fields [#278]
- Fixed myTemplates query so that `TemplateSearchResult` returns the `ownerDisplayName` specified in schema.
- Fixed an issue where adding `templateCollaborators` was failing due to the fact that the `userId` field was required.
- Was getting `undefined` bestPractice in `updateTemplate` when none was passed in because of the logic on how it was set. Added a check for whether `bestPractice` is defined before setting value. Also, added an update to `createTemplateVersion`, so that errors from the `generateTemplateVersion` will be caught and passed back in graphql response. Previously, when trying to save a DRAFT of a template, the mutation wouldn't return an error to the client, even though the `Save draft` did not successfully complete. [#265]
- Removed `Copy of` from in front of copied `Section` and `Template` names [#261]
- Fixed an issue where adding `templateCollaborators` was failing due to the fact that the `userId` field was required.
- Fixed an issue where adding `projectCollaborators` was failing due to the fact that the `userId` field was required. This should not be required to add a new collaborator [#260]
- When calling `updatePlanContributors`, the resolver should set isPrimaryContact to `false` for all contributors other than the one marked as isPrimary.
- Fixed an issue where Jest tests failed on Linux due to case-sensitive file paths. The tests passed on macOS because its file system is case-insensitive by default.
- Fixed bugs related to addPlanContributor and updatePlanContributor since these were not working without missing contributorRoles
- Converted DateTimeISO to String in schemas so that dates could be inserted into mariaDB database, and updated MySqlModel and associated unit test
