### Updated
- Format ORCID identifiers consistently, in the `Contributor` and `User` models, the `projectImport` resolver and `orcid` scalar.
- Changed a number of GraphQL definitions to PascalCase.
- Fixed projectCollaborators table which had an FKey on the plans table instead of the projects table
- Updated the `dmpHubAPI` datasource to support CRUD operations
- Updated the `Plan` resolver and model to support mutations
- Updated the `Affiliation` schema and model to include the new `apiTarget` property.
- Renamed old `planCollaborators` table to `projectCollaborators`
- Renamed old `PlanCollaborator` resolved functions so that they point to `ProjectCollaborator` since we decided to capture that at the project level
- Updated `ProjectService` permission check so that it looks at the ProjectCollaborators as well
- Updated `QuestionCondition` model to return the object with functions
- Updated `ContributorRole` model so that it has functions to associate them with `PlanContributor` records.
- Moved config for `dmpHubAPI` from the datasource into a `config/dmphubConfig.ts` file
- Removed old unused `Affiliation` methods from `dmpHubAPI` and added `getDMP` and `validate` (for use in the near future when syncing changes within our system and the DMPHub)
- Updated structure of `cacheConfig.ts` to match other configs
- Moved config for `MysSQLDataSource` from the datasource into its config file
- Moved `SigTerm` handler tests for `mysql` into a separate test file. They were failing for some reason when run together
- Refactored `context.ts` and tests to use new `dmpHubAPI` datasource
- Refactored old "mocks" to extract duplicative code into the `MySQLMock.ts`
- Update existing resolver tests to use new mocks
- Made sure all config entries were covered in the `__tests__/setup.ts`
- Updated the `emailService` to support `projectCollaborators` instead of `planCollaborators`
- Updated `question` and `section` resolvers to update `isDirty` in associated `template` when mutations were made. That way a user can `Save Draft` in the `Edit Template` page.
- Updated models and resolvers to handle errors in a consistent way
- Refactored the way Sections handle the association with Tag to follow pattern used elsewhere
- Updated `formatLogMessage` to accept the Apollo context instead of the logger so that it can being to record the `requestId`, `jti` and `userId` (when available)
- Updated `questionTypes` table to remove 'Rich Text Editor' and to add `usageDescription`. Also, updated Question model's `create` method to allow for entries with duplicate `questionText`
- Updated User update method to prevent password manipulation
- Updated User registration so that the terms and conditions must have been accepted
- Updated User schema, model and data migrations with new properties
- Change default JWT TTL to 30 minutes
- Added user id to the JTI to help ensure uniqueness
- Update sign out controller to always clear the cookies and return 200 regardless of the state of the tokens
- Updated `src/context.ts` to use a `buildContext` wrapper function that can be called when building the context for Apollo Server and our `signin` and `signup` endpoints.
- Updated use of `toUTCString()` to `toISOString()`
- Updated `tokenService` to properly catch and throw errors
- Updated `graphQLErrors` with more error types
- Added MariaDB to docker-compose
- data-migrations/README.md with instructions on running migrations in the Docker container
- tokenService now supports refresh tokens, CSRF tokens and signout
- updated express middelware to fetch the access token and refresh tokens from the cookies instead of the headers
- removed old oauth-server package which had security vulnerabilities
- moved authMiddleware function from the router.ts into its own class in src/middelware
- updated Affiliation Schema, Resolver, Models to use new affiliations tables in the database
- updated all of the cache key structures to wrap them in `{}` due to the way Redis handles keys in cluster mode
- updated emailService to use nodemailer and to support emailConfirmation templateCollaboration and planCollaboration email messages
- added bestPractice flag to the Section

### Removed
- Dropped the `PlanVersion` table
- Removed `prepareAPITarget` function.
- Removed `id` from `Project` model's constructor (already handled in base `MySQLModel`)
- Removed old `dmphubAPI` datasource and renamed `dmptoolAPI` to `dmpHubAPI`
- Old DMPHubAPI datasource and renamed DMPToolAPI to DMPHubAPI since that one had all of the new auth logic

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where adding `projectCollaborators` was failing due to the fact that the `userId` field was required. This should not be required to add a new collaborator [#260]
- When calling `updatePlanContributors`, the resolver should set isPrimaryContact to `false` for all contributors other than the one marked as isPrimary.
- Fixed an issue where Jest tests failed on Linux due to case-sensitive file paths. The tests passed on macOS because its file system is case-insensitive by default.
- Fixed bugs related to addPlanContributor and updatePlanContributor since these were not working without missing contributorRoles
- Converted DateTimeISO to String in schemas so that dates could be inserted into mariaDB database, and updated MySqlModel and associated unit test
